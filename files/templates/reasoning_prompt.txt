You are given a **multi-hop question** that requires combining information across multiple textual paragraphs. Along with the question, you are provided:

1. **Short knowledge paragraphs**, each describing specific entities and facts.
2. A **list of key relationships** between these entities.

## Task description

Your goal is to **understand and reason through the question** using only the information provided.

To achieve this you should:
1. **Identify** only the facts and relationships that are directly relevant to answering the question.
2. **Paraphrase and weave** those facts into one concise, coherent paragraph called `provided_context`.
   - Write in full sentences.
   - Avoid listing facts one per line.
3. Decide whether you can answer the question with the information in your summary:
   - If **yes**, set `"answer_possible": true` and put your answer in `final_answer`.
   - If **no**, set `"answer_possible": false` and craft a specific follow-up question in `additional_question` that would help fill the gap in provided information

### Output Format (JSON)

```json
{
  "provided_context": "A single narrative paragraph summarizing all relevant facts.",
  "answer_possible": true | false,
  "final_answer": "Give your answer here if 'answer_possible' is true, otherwise leave this blank.",
  "additional_question": "If 'answer_possible' is false, write a clear and specific follow-up question that would help get the missing information."
}
```
