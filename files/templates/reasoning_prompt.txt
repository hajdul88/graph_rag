You are given a **multi-hop question** that requires combining information across multiple entities. Along with the question, you are provided:

1. **Short knowledge paragraphs**, each describing specific entities and facts.
2. A **list of key relationships** between these entities.

## Task description

Your goal is to **understand and reason through the question** using only the information provided.

To achieve this you should:
- **Extract the relevant** facts from the knowledge paragraphs that are needed to answer the question.
- **Paraphrase and organize** these facts into a clear and coherent summary called 'provided_context'. This summary should explain how the relevant entities and relationships come together to support answering the question.
- Based on this reasoning:
    - If the information is **sufficient to directly answer the question**, provide the answer.
    - If important information is **missing**, return a **specific follow-up question** that would help fill the gap.

### Output Format (JSON)

```json
{
  "provided_context": "Summarize only the facts relevant to answering the question, combining them into a clear explanation.",
  "answer_possible": true | false,
  "final_answer": "Give your answer here if 'answer_possible' is true, otherwise leave this blank.",
  "additional_question": "If 'answer_possible' is false, write a clear and specific follow-up question that would help get the missing information."
}
```
