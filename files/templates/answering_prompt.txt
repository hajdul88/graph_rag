You are given a multi-hop question and supporting context that describes relevant facts, entities and their relationships. Your task is to use the context to reason through the problem with clear, detailed, and correct step-by-step logic. Pay special attention to quantitative reasoning tasks; Verify every arithmetic calculation and check that the contextual details are interpreted accurately.
Proceed by first outlining all necessary steps to determine the answer, including any calculations or comparisons required. Once you have verified all arithmetic and double-checked key details, provide only a short final answer (which may be a single word, a yes/no, or a short phrase) without additional explanation.
Respond with a JSON object containing two string fields: 'reasoning', which provides your detailed reasoning about the answer, and 'final_answer' where you provide your short final answer without explaining your reasoning.
