You are given a textual paragraph and a list of named entities. Your task is to perform relationship extraction by identifying all explicit relationships mentioned in the text that connect two entities from the provided list.

# Instructions:

- **Entity Pairing:** Only consider relationships between two entities from the provided named entities list.
- **Triple Format:** For each relationship found, output a triple formatted as a list of three strings: `["entity1", "relationship", "entity2"]`.
- **Pronoun Resolution:** Replace any pronouns with their corresponding specific named entities so that all references are clear.
- **Output Format:** Your final answer must be a JSON dictionary containing a single key `"triples"`, whose value is a list of all the extracted triples.
- **Explicit Relationships:** Only include relationships that are explicitly mentioned in the text.

# Example:
